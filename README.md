## Feature Set
1. Make mechanism for saving video of fencing lunge test (open_cv), should also allow video to be uploaded
2. take a video and give it to YOLO pose to identify keypoints (shoulder, left hip, right hip) other points such as the feet or knees may be interesting
3. plot the x,y coordinates of key points in space

### MVP Completed

4. Due some engineered feature extraction, acceleration, %back ...
5. build a dashboard to give quantative info

6. Build as a CLI tool?????

6. save the data to build a dataset for machine learning
7. train a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a fencing lunge test based on the data collected - probably about 50 datapoints needed but probably more than that - maybe I can plug in video from youtube for this.
